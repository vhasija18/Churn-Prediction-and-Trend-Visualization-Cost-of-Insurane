<h1 align = "center">Data Visualization</h1>
<p>Data Visualization is a combination of science and art to display information and data in graphical format. By using components like charts, graphs, maps and data visualization tools provide an accesible information, patterns, outliers and relation between the data.</p>
</p>
<p>During the course CS503B and CS504B we learnt the fundamentals of R and Python. These fundamentals are further used to visualise the data present. This visualization helped us to understand the relation between the different elements of the data. </p> 
</p>
<p>For this project I have visualized the data for an insurance organisation. Insurance industry is one of the backbone industry of any coutry. Using data of an insurance industry we will help this organization to visualize some data and realtion between different element like Age, Gender, Body Mass Index(BMI), Number of Children, Smoker Status of Person, Region from which Person belongs and Cost of Insurance. This visualization will help to understand the trends and shape the future decisions. </p>
